            The 2.34-m Vainu Bappu Telescope (VBT) is situated in the Javadi hills of Tamilnadu, at an elevation of about 750 m above the mean sea level. It is operated as a National Facility for optical astronomy. It has two foci, an f/3.5 prime focus (with an image scale of 27 arcsec/mm) and an f/13 Cassegrain focus (with a scale of 6.7 arcsec/mm). At the prime focus, CCD cameras are used for imaging with various filters. A high resolution Echelle spectrometer is in operation where the light is fed through an optical fibre from the prime focus directly to the spectrograph slit. A spectral resolution of 70000 has been achieved with the spectrograph in the visible range. By narrowing the slit, it is possible to obtain a spectral resolution better than 100,000. At the Cassegrain focus, an OMR spectrograph is used for low-to medium resolution spectroscopy. A Boller and Chivens CCD spectrograph earlier used for spectroscopy has been converted to a spectro-polarimeter.
